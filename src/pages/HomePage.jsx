          South Korea Wildfire Tragedy
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg text-black">
          Since March 21, 2025, South Korea has experienced a severe wildfire outbreak involving more than 20
          separate blazes occurring simultaneously across the country. The disaster has so far killed 32 people,
          including three firefighters and one government employee, and has led to the displacement of more than
          37,000 people. The first significant fire occurred in Sancheong County, followed by the now most significant
          fire in Uiseong County, prompting widespread evacuations and mobilizing extensive firefighting resources.
          In response to the emergency, several provinces were officially designated as disaster zones by the national government.
          <br />The wildfires have been deemed the worst in South Korea's history by acting president <strong>Han Duck-soo</strong>.
        </p>


        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-black">
          The Sancheong County fire began on March 21, 2025, and by the evening of March 22 had consumed approximately 1,200 acres (490 ha) of land.
          The mountainous topography combined with strong winds and dry conditions significantly hampered containment efforts, with firefighters
          achieving only 35% containment despite substantial deployment of resources for combating the wildfire after earlier reaching 70% containment.
          Fires in North Gyeongsang Province burned approximately 740 acres (300 ha), while Gimhae experienced additional significant fires requiring
          evacuations. A wildfire broke out in Ulsan, Ulju County.

          <br />Additional wildfire incidents were reported across central Chungcheong Province and southwestern
          Jeolla Province, indicating the nationwide scope of the emergency.

          <br />Additional wildfires that broke out simultaneously have affected multiple regions throughout
          central and southern South Korea. The Korea Forest Service issued its highest-level "severe" fire
          warnings for 12 locations, including Daejeon, Busan, and the North and South Gyeongsang Provinces.
          The alert was later issued for the whole country.

                The firefighting operation has involved nearly 1,600 personnel, 35 helicopters,
                and numerous ground vehicles. Acting President of South Korea Choi Sang-mok directed
                all relevant government agencies to employ the maximum available resources for fire
                suppression activities. The national administration formally declared North and South
                Gyeongsang provinces and Ulsan as disaster zones, enabling additional emergency
                resources and support measures.

                At least 37,829 people were displaced by the incident, which also required
                residents of 15 communities in the impacted areas to evacuate. This
                includes the relocation of 500 people in Uiseong County, scores of
                Gimhae inhabitants, and 260 residents of Sancheong County to temporary
                shelters after flames damaged their homes on the nearby hillsides.

          About 80 individuals had to be evacuated due to a wildfire that raged
          throughout Ulju County in Ulsan. Authorities also shut down a
          number of highway and railroad segments in the southeast, including
          a crucial corridor that links Ulsan and Busan, the country's
          second-largest metropolitan area. Following wildfires that
          spread from Uiseong to Cheongsong County, authorities also
          ordered the evacuation of 2,600 prisoners from Cheongsong
          Prison and 800 prisoners from Andong Prison.
